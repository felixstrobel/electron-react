# Getting Started with Electron-React-Template

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and a simple [electron](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/quick-start) app.

Do not forget to change the application's `name`, `description`, `author` and `appId`.

To get the app working run `yarn` in project directory and then `yarn start`.
