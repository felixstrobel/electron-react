# Getting Started with Electron-React-Template

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and a simple [electron](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/quick-start) app.

Do not forget to change the application's `name`, `description`, `author` and `appId`.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

The page will reload if you make edits.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The electron app is also bundled and combined with the React bundle.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
